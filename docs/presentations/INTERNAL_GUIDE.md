# AlgoBrain: Internal Guide

---

### **1. Introduction**

Welcome to the AlgoBrain project. This document serves as a comprehensive internal guide for team members, new hires, and cross-functional departments. Its purpose is to provide a clear and practical overview of the project, its architecture, and its development roadmap.

---

### **2. High-Level Architecture**

AlgoBrain is a multi-agent system designed for red-team operations, orchestrated through LangGraph. The system comprises a central supervisor agent and three specialized agents:

*   **Supervisor Agent:** Manages query analysis and routing.
*   **Traditional RAG Agent:** Handles payload and technique retrieval.
*   **GraphRAG Agent:** Manages attack chain analysis.
*   **Threat Intelligence Agent:** Provides real-time threat data.
