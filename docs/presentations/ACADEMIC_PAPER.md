# A Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation System for Offensive Security Operations

---

### **Abstract**

This paper introduces AlgoBrain, a novel multi-agent system that leverages a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to support offensive security operations. The system integrates a supervisor agent that orchestrates the interactions of specialized agents for traditional, graph-based, and real-time threat intelligence retrieval. We detail the system's architecture, the design of its specialized agents, and its hybrid knowledge base, which combines a graph database with a vector database. Our work demonstrates the viability of a multi-agent RAG system in the complex domain of cybersecurity, offering a significant advancement in AI-assisted penetration testing.

### **1. Introduction & Background**

The field of cybersecurity is characterized by an ever-evolving threat landscape and a persistent shortage of skilled professionals. Artificial intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has shown promise in addressing these challenges. However, the application of LLMs in offensive security requires a nuanced approach that goes beyond simple text generation. This paper presents AlgoBrain, a system designed to bridge this gap by providing a sophisticated, AI-powered research and analysis tool for penetration testers.

### **2. Related Work**

The application of AI in cybersecurity has been explored in various contexts, from intrusion detection to malware analysis. However, the use of agentic RAG systems in offensive security is a nascent field. Our work builds upon recent advancements in multi-agent systems, RAG, and knowledge graphs, adapting these technologies to the unique demands of red-team operations.

### **3. The AlgoBrain Architecture**

AlgoBrain employs a supervisor-based multi-agent architecture, orchestrated by LangGraph. This design allows for modularity and specialization, with a central supervisor agent routing queries to the most appropriate specialized agent.

*   **Supervisor Agent:** Utilizes Gemini 2.5 Flash for rapid query analysis and routing.
*   **Specialized Agents:**
    *   **Traditional RAG Agent:** For semantic search over unstructured data.
    *   **GraphRAG Agent:** For analyzing relationships and attack paths within a knowledge graph.
    *   **Threat Intelligence Agent:** For real-time data retrieval from external sources.

### **4. Methodology**

The development of AlgoBrain followed a structured methodology, encompassing:

*   **Systematic Literature Review:** To identify the state-of-the-art in agentic AI and cybersecurity.
*   **Iterative Prototyping:** To refine the multi-agent architecture and agent capabilities.
*   **Hybrid Knowledge Base Construction:** Integrating the MITRE ATT&CK framework with a vector database of cybersecurity knowledge.
