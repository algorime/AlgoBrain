# Knowledge Base - Detailed Research Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed research plan to address the gaps identified in the `RESEARCH_GAPS_ANALYSIS.md` document. It provides a structured set of actionable sub-tasks to guide the next phase of implementation. Each task is designed to produce a specific deliverable that will inform the engineering and development process.

The plan is organized into the four key research areas:
1.  **Schema & Ontology Implementation Details**
2.  **Ingestion Pipeline & AI Model-Specifics**
3.  **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) System Design**
4.  **Governance & Operationalization**

## 2. Schema & Ontology Implementation Details

### 2.1. `VulnerabilityPattern` Node Attribute Definition
*   **Objective:** To formally define the attributes of the `VulnerabilityPattern` node, which is a cornerstone of the zero-day lifecycle model.
*   **Deliverable:** A markdown document specifying the name, data type, and description for each attribute of the `VulnerabilityPattern` node (e.g., `CWE-ID`, `CommonConsequences`, `MitigationPatterns`, `CodeSnippets`).

### 2.2. Upper Ontology Formalization
*   **Objective:** To formally select, version, and define any necessary extensions for the Upper Ontology.
*   **Deliverable:** A markdown document that:
    1.  Confirms the selection of the **Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO)** and specifies the exact version to be used.
    2.  Details any required extensions or modifications to UCO to support our specific use case.

### 2.3. Temporal Modeling (Event Sourcing) Specification
*   **Objective:** To define the precise data model and query strategy for implementing temporal graph capabilities using an Event Sourcing pattern.
*   **Deliverable:** A technical specification document that includes:
    1.  The data model for storing events.
    2.  The query patterns for reconstructing the graph at a specific point in time.
    3.  A proof-of-concept script demonstrating a time-based graph projection.

### 2.4. Evidence Modeling Decision Framework
*   **Objective:** To create a clear and definitive framework for deciding when to model evidence as a simple relationship property versus using the more detailed `Evidence` node reification pattern.
*   **Deliverable:** A markdown document outlining the decision framework with clear criteria, examples, and a flowchart to guide developers.

## 3. Ingestion Pipeline & AI Model-Specifics

### 3.1. LLM Prompt Engineering for Relationship Extraction
*   **Objective:** To develop and version-control the specific prompts for relationship and attribute extraction from unstructured text.
*   **Deliverable:** A set of version-controlled files (e.g., in a `prompts/` directory) containing the exact "Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought" prompts and the corresponding few-shot examples.

### 3.2. LLM Fine-Tuning Strategy
*   **Objective:** To define a comprehensive strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models to improve their accuracy on our specific data.
*   **Deliverable:** A strategy document that details:
    1.  The datasets to be used for fine-tuning.
    2.  The technical architecture of the feedback loop from the HITL system.
    3.  The process for triggering and managing fine-tuning jobs.

### 3.3. `tree-sitter` Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) Traversal Algorithm
*   **Objective:** To specify the algorithm for traversing the CST generated by `tree-sitter` and converting it into structured features for the knowledge graph.
*   **Deliverable:** A document or a well-commented Python script that defines the heuristics and logic for parsing the CST and mapping language constructs to graph entities and relationships.

### 3.4. Embedding Model Selection and Validation
*   **Objective:** To select and validate the optimal embedding models for both code and natural language text to be used in entity linking and other similarity-based tasks.
*   **Deliverable:** A research report that:
    1.  Identifies the selected embedding models for code and text.
    2.  Presents the benchmark results and validation metrics used to justify the selection.

## 4. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) System Design

### 4.1. HITL Validation UI/UX Design
*   **Objective:** To design the user interface and define the workflow for the HITL system, enabling analysts to efficiently validate, correct, or reject AI-generated assertions.
*   **Deliverable:** A set of UI mockups (e.g., using Figma or Balsamiq) and a workflow diagram illustrating the end-to-end validation process.

### 4.2. HITL Feedback Loop Architecture
*   **Objective:** To design the technical architecture for the feedback loop that connects the HITL validation system to the model fine-tuning pipeline.
*   **Deliverable:** An architecture diagram and a technical document specifying the components, data flows, and APIs for collecting and routing validated data for model retraining.

## 5. Governance & Operationalization

### 5.1. Ontology Working Group (OWG) Charter
*   **Objective:** To formalize the creation and operation of the Ontology Working Group (OWG).
*   **Deliverable:** A formal charter document for the OWG defining its mission, members, responsibilities, meeting cadence, and the process for proposing, reviewing, and approving changes to the ontologies.

### 5.2. Federation Decision Framework
*   **Objective:** To create a quantitative and qualitative framework for deciding whether a new data source should be fully materialized in the graph or virtualized via federation.
*   **Deliverable:** A markdown document detailing the decision framework, including the specific criteria (e.g., query frequency, data volatility, complexity) and a scoring system to guide the decision.

### 5.3. Data Quality Monitoring Metrics and Tooling
*   **Objective:** To define the specific metrics and select the tools for automatically monitoring the quality of the knowledge graph data.
*   **Deliverable:** A monitoring plan that specifies:
    1.  The key data quality metrics (e.g., staleness, completeness, consistency).
    2.  The tools that will be used to implement the monitoring.
    3.  A dashboard mockup for visualizing the data quality metrics.
